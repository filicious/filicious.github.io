title: Filicious goes github pages!

I never used github pages with Jekyll before, but after reading the documentation for about an hour, it seems
to be a realy nice thing.

The most important reason why I decided to use github pages for the new project website is, that this make it
easier for contributors to change something on the website. clone, push, merge is all we need from now on :-)
